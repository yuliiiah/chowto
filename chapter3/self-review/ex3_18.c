// Chapter 3: Self-review exercise 3.18
// (Sales-Commission Calculator) One large chemical company pays its
//  salespeople on a commission basis. The salespeople receive $200 per week
//  plus 9% of their gross sales for that week. For example, a salesperson
//  who sells $5000 worth of chemicals in a week receives $200 plus 9% of
//  $5000, or a total of $650. Develop a program that will input each
//  salesperson’s gross sales for last week and will calculate and display
//  that salesperson’s earnings. Process one salesperson's figures at a
//  time. Here is a sample input/output dialog:
//      Enter sales in dollars (-1 to end): 5000.00
//      Salary is: $650.00
//      Enter sales in dollars (-1 to end): 1234.56
//      Salary is: $311.11
//      Enter sales in dollars (-1 to end): -1
