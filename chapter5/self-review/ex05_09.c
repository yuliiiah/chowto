// Chapter 5: Self-review exercise 5.9
// (Car Rental Services) A car rental service charges a minimum fee of $25.00
//  to rent a car for 8 hours, and charges an additional $5 per hour after 8
//  hours. The maximum charge per day is $50 exclusive of service tax. The
//  company charges an additional $0.50 per hour as service tax. Assume that
//  no car is rented for more than 72 hours at a time. If a car is rented for
//  more than 24 hours, then rental is calculated on a daily basis. Write a
//  program that calculates and prints the rental charges for each of three
//  customers who rented cars from this agency yesterday. You should enter
//  the hours for which the car has been rented for each customer. Your
//  program should print the results in a neat tabular format and should
//  calculate and print the total of yesterdayâ€™s receipts. The program should
//  use the function calculateCharges to determine the charges for each
//  customer. Your outputs should appear in the following format:
//      Car     Hours   Charge
//      1        12      56.00
//      2        34     117.00
//      3        48     124.00
//      TOTAL    94     297.00
